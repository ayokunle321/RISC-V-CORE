# My RISC-V MYTH Workshop Journey

This repo contains my notes, examples, and experiments from the RISC-V MYTH workshop I attended. It’s a way for me to track what I’m learning about the RISC-V ecosystem—from compiling C code to understanding how it runs on hardware.

## What I’m Working On Here

- Summaries of workshop sessions to help me remember key concepts  
- Sample programs and toolchain commands I’m practicing  
- Using the Spike simulator to step through RISC-V instructions  
- Notes on setting up and configuring the RISC-V development environment  

## Why This Matters to Me

I’m interested in getting a better grasp of how compilers, simulators, and hardware interact, especially around RISC-V. This is a practical step toward working on embedded systems and low-level software with real hardware in mind.

## How I Use This Repo

I add notes and code as I go through the workshop and try out the examples on my own machine. It helps me reinforce concepts and build a foundation for more advanced hardware and compiler work later.

## Setup

I’m using macOS, so my setup includes installing the RISC-V GNU toolchain and Spike simulator via Homebrew.
